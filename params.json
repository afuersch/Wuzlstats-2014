But *Wuzln* is the correct way.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nYou'll need IIS and .NET 4.5.1 to host this web application (built with ASP.NET MVC). Also, SQL Server is required for storing the scores.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get Wuzlstats up and running is to use the free tier of Azure:\r\n\r\n1. Fork the Wuzlstats repository on GitHub\r\n2. Log in to the Azure management portal. Create a free account if you don't have one yet.\r\n3. Create a new Website\r\n    1. Use your fork on GitHub for automatic publishing\r\n    2. Create a SQL Server database (the free 20 MB are more than enough). Use `Db` as the name for the connection string\r\n4. Done.\r\n","google":"UA-3250157-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
